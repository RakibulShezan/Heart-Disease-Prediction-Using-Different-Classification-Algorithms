# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Using-Different-Classification-Algorithms
Heart disease also known as Cardiovascular Diseases(CVDs) is currently one of the major reasons of death across the world. People are affected by different types of heart diseases and are from a wide range of ages. One factor that differs this disease from any other diseases is, most of the time it doesnâ€™t give any time to the patient to recover when an attack occurs. So identifying heart disease at an early stage can save many lives as well as be helpful for doctors to give appropriate treatments. Machine learning techniques can be a helpful mechanism to predict heart diseases. In this study, we applied some of the state of the machine learning algorithms on a publicly available heart disease dataset. We used Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVMs, Naive Bayes and Neural Networks. We got an accuracy of 85.54% with the Neural Networks model and a reasonable accuracy of 69.88% with the Decision Tree model.
